## Big Sleep

A simple command line tool for text to image generation, using OpenAI's CLIP and a BigGAN.

<a href="https://twitter.com/advadnoun">Ryan Murdock</a> has done it again, combining CLIP and the generator from a BigGAN. This repository wraps up his work so it is easily accessible to anyone who owns a GPU.
